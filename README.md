# Fluffy-chickens-WRO
This repository contains the arduino code and chassis plan for the laser cutting machine. Using 3 ultrasonic sensors, a huskylens, a motor and a steering servo; the goal of our autonomous robot was to lap the track 3 times.
Using an arduino as the microprocessor and C++ code, we were able to instruct our robot to circle the square track 3 times and end where it had started. :-)
The ultasonic sensors, measure the distance to surrounding walls, inform the arduino to then send out instrudtions on the directon and speed the motors should travel in to complete the 3 laps
